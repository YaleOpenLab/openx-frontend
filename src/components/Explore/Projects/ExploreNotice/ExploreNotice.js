          <p>
            If you are an investor, you can explore projects that are eligible
            for investment, each having a different set of risks and rewards depending on what stage
            the project is in. Projects in stage 1 have high risk and may
            eventually not be developed, but require angel support. Projects in
            stage 4 have gone through due diligence and have defined budgets and
            contracts in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a developer, or solar service provider, you can explore projects
            that are currently open for tender.
