          We are building an open source platform that leverages
          decentralization technology for disintermediation of financial
          processes and contractual automation to drive community-owned solar
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenSolarâ€™s core technology seeks to streamline the flow of
          crowd-based funds (eg. bonds and equity) to finance the deployment of
          solar assets, allowing end-users to own these resources in a short
          time frame through regular utility-like payments driven by energy
          generation and consumption IoT data.
