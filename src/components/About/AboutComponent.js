              We are building an open source platform that leverages
              decentralization technology for disintermediation of financial
              processes and contractual automation to drive community-owned
              solar projects.

            <p>
              OpenSolarâ€™s core technology seeks to streamline the flow of
              crowd-based funds (eg. bonds and equity) to finance the deployment
              of solar assets, allowing end-users to own these resources in a
              short time frame through regular utility-like payments driven by
              energy generation and consumption IoT data.
